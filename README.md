# tensorflow2-object-detection-tutorial

I have created this Github repository for saving a version of the Tensorflow 2 Object Detection colab notebook that actually works.
When trying the official version in the tensorflow 2 github repository I came across some errors as you can see in this video. So I made some changes in order to make it work.

I will add more meat into this readme soon.
